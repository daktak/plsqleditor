<P>How to Use Toby's PL/SQL Editor.

<P>This page is still under construction. Please be patient and
hopefully it will eventually become a more useful aid.

<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>An example of a package body file</B> This example of
	a <A HREF="tmp_fake.pkb">package body file</A> is not complete, but
	it should give you an idea of how to write a package body file that
	has the correct outline and parsing etc. 
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>An example of a package body file to be wrapped</B> 
	This example of	a <A HREF="tmp_fakewrapped.pkb">package body file to be wrapped</A>
	should give you an idea of how to write a package body file that requires the comment to 
	occur before the package name and will still have the correct outline and parsing etc. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>An example of a pkg file (that
	contains both header and body in one)</B> can be seen <A HREF="tmp_fakepkg.pkg">here</A>.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Directory structure for you pl
	sql code.</B> The best thing you can do is have your schemas in
	separate directories - one directory per schema. This way it will be
	easy for the editor to find all of your packages per schema. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Package Naming Format</B> The
	editor expects your package files to be named
	schemaname_pkgname.pkb. If you don't name them in this way, there is
	no guarantee that the editor will correctly assign your package to
	its schema. You can override this by going to the preferences and
	assigning particular packages to particular files. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Database access support.</B>
	There are several components of database access support. 
	</P>
	<OL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Configuring default access to
		the database</B> These connection details will be used by each
		project if you do not set project specific connection settings.
		They can be overridden by specifying project specific properties.
		This involves navigating to the Database Connectivity Setup
		Preference Page within the PL/SQL Preferences. Once you have
		navigated there, you must specify an Oracle driver. The default
		driver that is supplied with the plugin is
		&quot;oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver&quot;. You must also specify
		the database connect url. It must be in the format
		&quot;jdbc:oracle:thin:@hostname:1521:SID&quot; where the hostname
		is the name of your database host (or localhost if local), the 1521
		should map to your database port (although usually 1521 is the
		correct port - it is the default) and SID is your Service
		Identifier, the database id if you will. You can leave the initial
		and max connections as 1 and 1, since I don't think it should be
		possible to use more than one at a time within the eclipse
		architecture. This is built in for future enhancements where the
		same connection might be used for separate purposes. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Configuring the dba user for
		database procedure/function content assist</B> This involves
		modifying the user name and password on the same Database
		Connectivity Setup Preferences Page. This can also be overridden
		per project on the project properties Database Connectivity Setup
		<I>Properties</I> Page. The user name and password here should have
		dba access so they can query the schema, package and procedure
		tables to allow content assist to present these methods to the
		user. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Configuring each schema to
		allow upload of code to the database.</B> 
		The way that this had to be done prior to release 0.4.0 involved modifying
		the schema objects in the Schema Mapping Preference Page screen
		located on the properties page of a PlSql project. Each project may
		have different schemas, so each project will need to be configured
		individually. Each schema has a name, a list of comma separated
		locations and a password. The schema name is the user and the
		password is the password for that user. The database connection
		string is the same as the dba database connection string and the
		driver is the same too. By setting the password for a schema, you
		allow yourself to upload code for that schema.<BR>If this
		description is too brief, try a <A HREF="dbcon/database_connectivity.html">visually
		guided walkthrough</A>.
		<b>HOWEVER, NEW FEATURE!</b> As of 0.4.0 you can right click in the editor of the open file you wish to 
        set to a new schema and select the &lt;Change Schema for Package&gt; item from the popup menu.
        This will allow you to specify the name of the package (which you can change to whatever package 
        name you want, although it will be defaulted to the name it believes is correct) and the schema.
        This will update the schema mappings to allow code loading and schema DML to be executed.
        The old way still works, but the new way is much easier.

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Database Execution</B> 
	</P>
	<OL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Executing sql to the database</B>
		You can execute the selected block of text as a set of commands to
		the database by selecting the block of text and pressing Ctrl-Alt-E
		or right clicking and selecting Execute PL/SQL from the immediate
		menu. You may also execute a block separated by empty lines above
		and below by having the cursor on the block between the empty lines
		and pressing Ctrl-Alt-E or right clicking and selecting Execute
		PL/SQL from the immediate menu. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Loading a file to the database</B>
		The editor allows you to load the package body or header that is currently open
		to the database.
		In the main preferences page (seen <A HREF="images/main_preferences.png">here</A>)
		you can choose whether the load to database action should ask you to save
		a dirty file before continuing. 
		There are three options
		<ul>
			<li> Don't ask - This means the load to database will take the current file
			without saving it</li>
			<li> Always save - This means the load to database will always save a dirty file
			before generating the header.</li>
			<li> Prompt for save - This means that if the file is dirty the action will
			ask the user if s/he wants to save prior to continuing. If the user says yes
			the file will be saved, otherwise it will not, but the action will continue regardless</li>
		</ul>
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Viewing DBMS Output</B> You
		can turn dbms output on for each schema in which you are working.
		In order to see (turn on) any dbms output you must open a file that
		refers to that schema (and you can check this by pressing the
		&ldquo;Display Debug Information&rdquo; button (<IMG SRC="images/target.gif" NAME="DebugIcon" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>).
		Then you must open the DbmsOutput view (in Show View). Once this is
		open you must press the button to turn it on (seen in this <A HREF="images/dbms_output_turn_on.png">image</A>)
		and respond yes to the <A HREF="images/turn_on_dbms_msg.png">dialog</A>
		asking you if you want to turn on that dbms output. This can be
		used a a double check to ensure you are turning on dbms output for
		the right schema. Turning it off simply uses the other button on
		the view.

	<OL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Code Folding</B> Currently the
		plsqleditor provides code folding so that you can right click on a
		selected block and make it folding. You can also specify a code
		fold by typing in the correct format folding. This is in the format
		of the string &quot;--#startFolding&quot; <B>on a line all by
		itself</B> to start and the string &quot;--#endFolding&quot; <B>on
		a line all by itself</B> to finish. <BR>Code folding will be
		updated eventually when I have implemented a parser, so that code
		folding will also fold on blocks, ifs, loops, functions etc. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Uppercasing</B> You can
		uppercase by pressing the uppercase button on the toolbar, or right
		clicking and selecting uppercase from the PlSqlEdit menu, or
		pressing Ctrl-Alt-U while you have selected the block to uppercase.
				</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Lowercasing</B> You can
		lowercase by pressing the lowercase button on the toolbar, or right
		clicking and selecting lowercase from the PlSqlEdit menu, or
		pressing Ctrl-Alt-O while you have selected the block to lowercase.
				</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Commenting Code</B> You can
		add a comment (--) to a line, or series of lines by right clicking
		and selecting &quot;add a single comment to the beginning of the
		line&quot; from the PlSqlEdit menu, or pressing Ctrl-/ while you
		have the cursor over the line you want commented, or you have
		selected a block to comment. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Uncommenting Code</B> You can
		remove a comment (--) from a line, or series of lines by right
		clicking and selecting &quot;remove a single comment from the
		beginning of the line&quot; from the PlSqlEdit menu, or pressing
		Ctrl-Shift-/ while you have the cursor over the line you want
		uncommented, or you have selected a block to uncomment. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Shifting Code left and right</B> 
		You can shift a set of lines of code right by selecting the block of 
		code you wish shifted and pressing Tab. The functionality is also
		available in the right click popup menu under the name &quot;Shift Right&quot;.
		This will shift the code one tab to the right. You can shift the 
		code to the left similarly by pressing Shift-Tab, or selecting the
		&quot;Shift Left&quot; action from the right click popup menu.
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Generating Headers for package
		bodies</B>
		The editor allows you to generate headers for package body files.
		In the main preferences page (seen <A HREF="images/main_preferences.png">here</A>)
		you can choose whether the header generation action should ask you to save
		a dirty file before continuing. 
		There are three options
		<ul>
			<li> Don't ask - This means the header generation will take the current file
			without saving it</li>
			<li> Always save - This means the header generation will always save a dirty file
			before generating the header.</li>
			<li> Prompt for save - This means that if the file is dirty the action will
			ask the user if s/he wants to save prior to continuing. If the user says yes
			the file will be saved, otherwise it will not, but the action will continue regardless</li>
		</ul>
		Details<br>
		<ul>
		<li>Generating the headers requires that you correctly pldoc the procedures and functions
		    that you wish to be part of the header. If you wish to pldoc a private function or
		    procedure, you can mark it as private by placing an &quot;@private&quot; tag in the
		    documentation.</li>
		<li>If you need a package to have a non standard authid, you can place an 
		    &quot;@authid current_user&quot; tag in the comment section that contains the
		    header details. The example identified at the top of this documentation contains
		    this example.
		</li>
		<li>If you need a procedure or method to have a pragma statement attached to the generated
		    header, you can use the &quot;@pragma&quot; tag with the pragma statement after it.
		    The example pkb file contains this.
		</li>
		</ul>
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Auto completing procedures and functions</B>
		You can auto complete functions with the standard Ctrl-Space content assist.
		The format that these come out in depends on the settings you select from
		the Formatting Preferences (seen <A HREF="images/formatting_preferences.png">here</A>).
		<ul>
		<li> The &quot;Put Semi colon after proc/func calls&quot; allows the content assist
		     to generate the semi colon after completion.</li>
		<li> The &quot;Align the assignment arrows in proc/func calls&quot; allows the
		     content assist to ensure all the assignment arrows (=%gt;) to be in the 
		     same column.</li>
		<li> The &quot;For procedure and function auto completion, use parameter Names
		     instead of types&quot; allows the content assist to generate
		     &quot;pis_name =&gt; pis_name&quot; instead of &quot;pis_name =&gt; blah%TYPE&quot; 
		     </li>
		<li> The &quot;For procedure and function auto completion, put parameters on
		     new line&quot; allows the content assist to put each parameter declaration
		     on a new line.</li>
		<li> The &quot;For procedure and function auto completion, put commas on
		     new line&quot; allows the content assist to put the commas in front of
		     each parameter rather than after, i.e 
		     &quot;,pis_name =&gt; t_type&quot; instead of &quot;pis_name =&gt; t_type,&quot; 
		     </li>
		</ul>
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>todo and fixme tasks</B>
		You can add todo and fixme tags to a file. These will pop up in the task list
		when you open the file, and you will see them marked in the ruler section of the editor.
		<ul>
		<li> TODO tasks will be medium priority</li>
		<li> FIXME tasks will be high priority</li>

	<P>It ought to be noted that the schema browser will run a query

	computationally and i/o operation intensive. Consequently, it is
	useful to filter out the schemas whose packages you do not need to
	see in the schema browser. These can be filtered by specifying a
	list of regular expressions that, if matched will cause those
	matched schemas to be ignored (for the purpose of displaying the
	packages). It is useful for packages such as the SYS and CTX
	schemas.
