How to Use Toby's PL/SQL Editor.
</p>
<p>
This page is still under construction. Please be patient and hopefully it 
will eventually become a more useful aid.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Directory structure for you pl sql code. <br>
	The best thing you can do is have your schemas in separate directories
	- one directory per schema. This way it will be easy for the editor to
	find all of your packages per schema.</li>
	<li>Package Naming Format <br>
	The editor expects your package files to be named
	schemaname_pkgname.pkb. If you don't name them in this way, there is no
	guarantee that the editor will correctly assign your package to its
	schema. You can override this by going to the preferences and assigning
	particular packages to particular files.</li>
	<li>Dabase access support. <br>
	There are several components of database access support.
	<ol>
		<li>Configuring access to the database <br>
		This involves navigating to the Database Connectivity Setup Preference
		Page within the PL/SQL Preferences. Once you have navigated there, you
		must specify an Oracle driver. The default driver that is supplied
		with the plugin is &quot;oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver&quot;. You
		must also specify the database connect url. It must be in the format
		&quot;jdbc:oracle:thin:@hostname:1521:SID&quot; where the hostname is
		the name of your database host (or localhost if local), the 1521
		should map to your database port (although usually 1521 is the correct
		port - it is the default) and SID is your Service Identifier, the
		database id if you will. You can leave the initial and max connections
		as 1 and 1, since I don't think it should be possible to use more than
		one at a time within the eclipse architecture. This is built in for
		future enhancements where the same connection might be used for
		separate purposes.</li>
		<li>Configuring the dba user for database procedure/function content
		assist <br>
		This involves modifying the user name and password on the same
		Database Connectivity Setup Preference Page screen. The user name and
		password here should have dba access so they can query the schema,
		package and procedure tables to allow content assist to present these
		methods to the user.</li>
		<li>Configuring each schema to allow upload of code to the database. <br>
		This involves modifying the schema objects in the Schema Mapping
		Preference Page. Each schema has a name, a list of comma separated
		locations and a password. The schema name is the user and the password
		is the password for that user. The database connection string is the
		same as the dba database connection string and the driver is the same
		too. By setting the password for a schema, you allow yourself to
		upload code for that schema.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
