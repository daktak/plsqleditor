<h1>Comparing files with the db</h1>
You can compare a package body, package header, or combination file with the database by
right clicking on the representation of the file in the Navigator (file explorer) and 
selection Compare to Project Default DB.
Currently it will only use the default schema that your project is looking at for the file, 
even if you have configured a specific connection for the particular file to go to.
This is intentional as a first cut.
For more information on configuring specific connections, please see 
<a href="../concepts/file_specific_connections.html">this page</a>.
