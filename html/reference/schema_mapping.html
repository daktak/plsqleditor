<h1>Schema Mapping</h1>
Schema Mapping takes place in the Project Properties, as seen in this <a href="../concepts/dbcon/database_connectivity.html">guide</a>.
There, you specify a: <br/>
<ol>
<li>schema name</li> 
<li>directory/directories (and relative context) that contain files in that schema</li>
<li>the database password for that schema. The connection details are assumed to 
be the default project setting ones found in the preferences, or overridden in the 
database connectivity properties of the project.</li>
</ol>

On a per file basis you can set the schema for a particular file by the following mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Right clicking in the editor of the open file and selecting "Change Schema for Package"</li>
<li>Switching to the details tab in the editor and pressing the "Change Schema for Package" button on that tab.</li>
<li>In the top comment section (where the header details may be added as described in the <a href="../concepts/doc/how_to_use.html">howto guide</a>
    you can add an @schema xxx tag, where xxx is the schema name</li>
<li>Manipulating the schema mapping file, which is located at <workspace_location>/.metadata/.plugins/plsqleditor/{project_name}_schemaMappingsFile.store</li>.
</ul>
However, there are easier techniques than manipulating the mapping file by file.

<h1>Auto Schema Mapping and Loading</h1>
In order to save having to set up an association per file, you can do the following:
<ul>
<li>Follow the Default naming convention. The default naming convention is that each 
package file will have the format SCHEMA_NAME DELIMITER PACKAGE_NAME DOT EXTENSION.
The DELIMITER defaults to underscore.
Doing this will mean every file you open will automatically be put in the right package, 
once a single file is opened in that directory, the rest will be auto-loaded.</li>
<li>how to override - The DELIMITER defaults to underscore (_) but can be modified 
in the preferences page (as schema to package delimiter) or per project in the project 
properties database connectivity page.</li>
</ul>
