If someone has asked a question that is likely to be asked again, you should be able to find
it repeated (in a more generic fashion) here. <br/>
Happy hunting.

<h2><b>Answers</b></h2>

        You can manually select a schema (by creating a new schema in the Schema Mapping Preferences Page).
        <br/>
        In this new schema, you need to add all the directories (which are specified relative to the 
        Project, i.e specify the full path minus the path to the directory - so 
        C:/dev/MyProject/files/plsql becomes files/plsql) that you wish to use for that 
        schema into a comma separated list in the Location field of the schema.
        <br/>
        Once you have done this, it should allow you to map the schema to the files in that directory. 
        <b>NEW FEATURE!</b> As of 0.4.0 you can right click in the editor of the open file you wish to 
        set to a new schema and select the &lt;Change Schema for Package&gt; item from the popup menu.
        This will allow you to specify the name of the package (which you can change to whatever package 
        name you want, although it will be defaulted to the name it believes is correct) and the schema.
        This will update the schema mappings to allow code loading and schema DML to be executed.
    </li>
    <li><a name="0.2"><b>How do I get the F3 lookup functionality to work?</b></a><br>
    	When your schema mappings are not instantiated (the first time you use the editor, or
    	the first time you add new source to your editor via an external mechanism - cvs, copying etc)
    	the F3 lookup will not work because it does not know about the files to which the code you 
    	are looking at is referring.
    	You can fix this by forcing the editor to load the files, following the instructions below:
    	<ol>
    	<li> Ensure that your Database Connectivity Settings are correct, either on a per Project or global Level.</li>
    	<li> For each schema, <ctl-space> the schema name.</li>
    	<li> For one package in each schema, <ctl-space> the package name. </li>
    	</ol>
    	<br>
		This should allow the "F3" functionality to work by updating the schema mappings. 
	</li>
</ul>
