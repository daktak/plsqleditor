<body>
This section covers the types of auto completion that you can manage in the Editor.
There are two main types of auto completion - <br></br>
<ol>
<li>the coded auto completion</li>
<li>the template driven auto completion (standard eclipse based templates)</li>
</ol>
<p></p> 

<h1>Coded Auto Completion in the Editor</h1>
Auto completion has been coded to auto complete the following types of structures:

<ul>
<li>built in functions of plsql such as upper, lower, substr etc</li>
<li>schemas that are identified by the <a href="../reference/schema_mapping.html"> schema mapping</a></li>
<li>schemas that are detected by the <a href="db_connectivity.html"> connection to the database </a></li>
<li>packages that are detected by the <a href="../reference/schema_mapping.html"> schema mapping</a></li>
<li>packages that are detected by the <a href="db_connectivity.html"> connection to the database </a></li>
<li>procedures and functions that are detected in files identified in the <a href="../reference/schema_mapping.html"> schema mapping</a></li>
<li>procedures and functions that are detected by the <a href="db_connectivity.html"> connection to the database </a></li>
<li>tables and columns that are detected by the <a href="db_connectivity.html"> connection to the database </a></li>
<li>constants, local variables, procedure names (for end proc_name) etc that are in the local file being edited</li>
</ul>

These structures will be updated with the information in the files in your file system and
in your database (if you connect to a database).
Items not currently covered are:
<ul>
<li>types</li>
<li>array count, first, last, next</li>
<li>records and contained record fields</li>
<li>objects and their contained fields</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h1>Template based Auto Completion in the Editor</h1>
Template auto completion has been enabled in Toby's PL/SQL editor to allow users to 
determine their own auto completable structures. By default a new package body auto complete
is present, along with new procedure, new function, begin end, for loops, while loops etc.
You can modify the provided ones, and add new ones.
There are two types of templates - code templates and pldoc templates. 
<p></p>
<b>Code templates</b>
<ul>
<li>if constructs - if, if else, if elsif else</li>
<li>for loop constructs - for n, for array, for record in cursor</li>
<li>while loop constructs - basic loop while, standard loop over hash</li>
<li>new package body</li>
<li>new procedure, new function</li>
<li>begin exception block</li>
<li>savepoint</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<b>Document templates</b>
<ul>
<li>true</li>
</ul>

<p>

You can add templates using the standard eclipse interface for managing templates.
