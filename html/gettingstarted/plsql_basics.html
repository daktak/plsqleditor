<h1>PL/SQL Basics</h1>
This section here identifies some plsql basics that have been incorporated
into the editor.

<p></p>
<h2>pragmas</h2>
RESTRICT_REFERENCES
This allows TBD. It can be supported in the editor by TBD.

<h2>authid</h2>
CURRENT_USER
This allows TBD. It can be supported in the editor by TBD.

<h2>packages</h2>
Packages are one technique that Oracle uses to group executable functionality. <br/>
Packages can contain types, objects, constants, cursors, procedures and functions. <br/>
They do not contain tables.<br/>
This is the primary type of file that the plsql editor supports.
You can edit any file that has sql components in it, but at the moment the
most strength comes from package files.
