<h1>Creating a new file</h1>
Toby's PL/SQL Editor was originally created to support editing of a
large number of package files across a broad number of schemas in an
oracle database.
<br />
Consequently this editor focuses on managing multiple schemas and on
file based manipulation and navigation.
<br></br>
Over time database connectivity has been added and enhanced, but this
editor has a strong file based bias.
<p></p>
The current parser implementation is a regular expression parser that
has been cobbled together to meet the needs of the people in my team at
work and those who post comments on sourceforge.
<br></br>
It works primarily on package body, package header and combined
header/body files. The latest release (0.5.4) provides a helper method
to create you a file that will satisfactorily be parsed by the parser.
There are a few quirks you need to satisfy for your file to be properly
parsed, and the new file wizard ensures you satisfy them.
<p></p>
If you have any issues, a copy of a valid
<A HREF="../concepts/doc/tmp_fake.pkb">package body file</A>
can be used as a demo (if you don't want to use the new file wizard.
<p></p>
The new file wizard is located under File - New - Other - PLSQL Editor
Wizards - New PLSQL File.
This wizard is also available from the File - New menu if you are in the 
Toby's PL/SQL Editor perspective. If you don't see it in the File - new menu
you may have to reset the perspective: Window - Reset Perspective.
